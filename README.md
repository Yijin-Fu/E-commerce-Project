## Methodology

- Phase 1: Customers -- This section focuses on customer demographics, including geographical distribution and trends over time. It uses heat maps to illustrate where customers are located and how customers are distributed so that the business can efficiently manage its supply chain and warehouse. The line chart showcases how customer numbers have changed over the time. Once there is a significant change between two monthes or within a certian period presented by the chart, the business can dive into the data to implement detailed research for the purpose of figuring out root causes.

- Phase 2: Sales -- Here, the emphasis is on financial data like total payment values and sales figures. Semi-pie charts are used to depict COGS ratio and margin which support the business owner to monitor the sales performance. Addition to that, a stacked line chart are provided to illustrate the differences between total sales and costs which also includes the revenue. A table is also included in this page, which provides an overview of the financial performance to the whole business divided by quarters. Profit margins that exceed the set goal for the quarter are highlighted with a green symbol. This visual cue makes it easy to identify periods of particularly strong financial performance.

- Phase 3: Orders
-- This part analyzes order-related data, such as the number of orders over time, processing periods, and delivery status. It employs stacked-bar charts to showcase efficiency in order processing and delivery progress, such that the business is able to recognize which process is doing well and which process needs improvement. The waterfall chart provides analysts with a comprehensive understanding of the changes in order volumes relative to the previous quarter, offering a clear visual representation of this data comparison.
